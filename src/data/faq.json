    "question": "How do you make decisions as a founder? (do you use your instinct, data or talk to advisors)",
    "answer": "I start with instinct. Then I validate it with data (I know how & where to find data that matter). Finally, I seek input from people in the field. It’s never just one approach—it’s a mix of all three. But at my core, I trust data and instinct more than external advice."

    "answer": "Mental health is at an inflection point—demand surged post-pandemic, AI-driven therapy is gaining traction, and digital solutions are becoming mainstream. Governments and businesses are investing in mental health, and stigma is fading fast.\n\n    Technological advancements like LLMs, RAGs, AI agents, and telemedicine are opening up new opportunities.\n\n    Five years ago, the awareness wasn’t there. Five years from now, competition will be intense, and AI regulations will tighten. The window for building a dominant mental health AI platform is right now.",

    "question": "What’s one unconventional belief you have about startups?",
    "answer": "People assume, “If we build it, they will come.”\n\n    Reality? Neither the users nor the founders actually know what the right solution looks like at the start.\n\n    Startups don’t succeed because of a perfect idea. They succeed through constant iteration and customer development. The idea, solution, and even target users will evolve. The only constant is the founder’s deep connection to the vision—if they have one. Otherwise, even that can change."

    "answer": "OpenAI is broad—it won’t pivot its entire infrastructure just for this.    Competitors exist, but many are either highly institutional or run by new startup, both haven't yet solved the main problem yet. Blissm is approaching the problem differently. We’re treating users as co-creators, not just consumers—something most players in this space ignore.    User trust and community-driven models are critical. AI alone won’t solve mental health—it’s about how you integrate AI with human behavior and trust-building. That’s our edge.",

    "question": "If you could only use one growth channel, what would it be?",
    "answer": "Virality & Network Effects.\n\n    I love this channel because it’s free, fast and complex. Mental health is serious, but I’m exploring ways to mix it with unconventional elements—like memes and confession walls. A situation-based Meme Engine powered by user-generated content could drive viral growth.\n\n    The challenge? Making serious mental health topics shareable in a way that spreads awareness without trivializing the issue. But that’s exactly why I find it fascinating."

    "answer": "Most recently, I built my personal website in a week. I’ve also built an app in just two days, though integrating different technologies took more time. Before that I have created Blissm App MVP, Attendance App, Research repo web app, and few more projects.\n    I maximize my speed by leveraging frameworks, APIs, libraries, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot—these tools save time debugging and handling repetitive tasks. My focus is on logic, structure, and design.",

    "question": "Why are you the right person to solve this problem?",
    "answer": "I’m an engineer by education and a designer by passion. I’ve always been a problem solver and critical thinker. While I was drawn to psychology, I was naturally good at mathematics, which led me into tech. Now, I’m a developer with a deep interest in AI and deep learning.\n\n    I may not be a therapist, but I’ve spent time understanding their language. I’ve read books on CBT, taken courses like Building Personal Resilience: Managing Anxiety and Mental Health, and engaged in discussions with people struggling with mental health. Each conversation adds more depth and emotional weight to my mission.\n\n    More importantly, I understand what it’s like to want support but not know where to find it. Growing up, I wished someone would help me break free from my small-town limitations. That innate desire to help people fuels my obsession with building something that can make a real impact.\n\n    Technically, mentally, and emotionally, I’m all in. Now, I’m focused on scaling impact, virality, and business strategy."

    "answer": "My journey started in high school when I unexpectedly became a caregiver for my relatives. I saw firsthand how stress and trauma affected both patients and caregivers—and I realized mental health was often overlooked. Initially, I wanted to build a healthcare app—something like a review and rating platform for hospitals and medical staff. But after taking an Entrepreneurship in Emerging Markets course on edX and learning about telemedicine, I started exploring mental health.\n\n    Then, I attended a mental health event (IMHS) and met advocates in the field. We had deep conversations, and I casually pitched the idea of AI in mental health. The excitement I saw in their reactions made me realize this was worth pursuing. So, I built an MVP during my winter break. Along the way, I immersed myself in The Lean Startup, Customer Development, and Agile Development. That’s when I decided to pause technical development and focus on people—understanding users and therapists.\n\n    Mental health isn’t just an abstract problem for me. Studying the mental health landscape in India made me realize how much it connects to my own experiences—how my parents, the people around me, and even I have struggled with it. I’ve had my share of lows, but I was fortunate to have a support system. I want to build something for those who don’t.",

    "answer": "Success, to me, is the impact Blissm has on people’s lives. My goal is to democratize mental health support. And I don’t believe the solution will come from technology alone—it will be a combination of tech, human expertise, and cultural shifts."

    "answer": "I keep moving, even at a slow pace. When I got rejected from the SURF internship, I didn’t stop—I completed an entire course while working on Blissm.\n\n    Rejection sucks, but I channel it into action. If I feel stuck, I take a break—go to the beach, talk to friends, or watch a movie. Then I reset and keep going."
